# 🚀 Master the Workflow: A Full Project Build from Scratch

Welcome to a hands-on, day-by-day guide for building a complete Machine Learning project—from local setup to cloud deployment—using modern DevOps and MLOps practices.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository walks you through:
- 🔧 Environment setup and GitHub integration
- 🧱 Component-based pipeline architecture
- 📊 EDA, model training, and evaluation
- 🧪 Hyperparameter tuning and final model selection
- 🌐 Flask web app for real-time predictions
- ☁️ Deployment to AWS and Azure using CI/CD pipelines

Each day is documented in a separate markdown file for modular learning and reuse.
